# MvSPG - Metroidvania Structure Procedural Generation

**Metroidvania Structure Procedural Generation (MvSPG)** is a tool for procedural generation and visualization of Metroidvania game layouts originally developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis on procedural generation applied to level design. 

The aim of the project is to create a general-use algorithm that can generate levels for any Metroidvania project by considering the set of mechanics and upgrades present. As of now only structural generation is implemented with content generation coming in the future. Furthermore, the current version selects all upgrades randomly from a pre-made pool instead of user input, as they are all effectively equivalent for the purposes of structural generation.

Using this tool you can modify various configuration parameters for the procedural generation algorithm, visualize the process step-by-step, and analyze results.

Consult information on the generated level's main route steps, including rewards and area to route step relations, as well as information on the content and borders of a grid unit, in order to get a deeper understanding of the generated layout.

## Controls

Interact with the interface and select a map unit using left click, move the camera using right click, hide or show the UI with the TAB key and reset the generation process using the R key.
